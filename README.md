RadioBot is a Discord bot made with Javascript and Discord.js that joins your server and sticks on your preferred channel to play 24/7 your favourite songs, **for free**.

## How it works

It is important to state that Radiobot is not a typical music bot. Its main objective is not to be a music player for your Discord server. Instead, even though you can still achieve a similar behaviour, it is built to be a music station.

Every server will have a song list, which can be modified restrictionless, and you will be able to choose any song from that list and start playing it **24/7**. In addition, you will need to choose a voice channel from your server and Radiobot **will not leave** that channel **until it is actually disconnected**.

You can still unlock special (yet free) features to extend Radiobot's functionality, such as being able to play the whole song list, shuffle it, add longer songs, etc.

### Voting
RadioBot  also has a 'premium' feature, yet completely free, to allow those who really enjoy RadioBot to take the maximum potential.

It uses the voting system of Top.gg to allow people to get benefits from voting and surpass the limits that RadioBot hs. You will be able to exchange your votes for benefits on your servers where RadioBot is active.

## Open source

### Self-hosting
I encourage you to run your own version of Radiobot. However, I won't give any support or 'how-to' guides for this. You'll have to study yourself the source code in order to self-host it.

### Contributing
I am open to public contributions of any kind. They can be software contributions, code additions, etc. (please, use PR for this), hardware contributions adding more audio servers (better contact me via Discord or email if it's the case), and a large etc.

## Contact
Use any contact method specified in my Github profile. They will be more updated than anything I could write in this Readme.
